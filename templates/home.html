{%block content%} Welcome to the website for Team 13’s case study 2 project in iCons 1! In February of 2021 during a major winter storm, Texas suffered a massive electrical grid failure, leaving millions of Americans without power for multiple days. The occurrence of blackouts such as those in Texas this year and Ohio in 2003 indicate that there is a need for continuing improvement in the efficiency and reliability of electrical grids. The accelerating effects of climate change are causing severe weather patterns to occur more frequently, and this trend puts electrical grids at further risk of failure. Expanding the use of renewable energy as a fuel source will help to gradually mitigate the effects of climate change. The purpose of our calculator is to take user inputs about the initial percent of electricity generated from each energy source in Texas and return multiple graphs. The graphs show annual energy production, reliability, carbon emissions, percent distribution of sources over time, and also annual construction and consumer costs. The goal of our calculator is to determine the optimal distribution of energy sources for the Texas electrical grid to reduce the severity of future grid failures, carbon emissions, and financial cost. We hope you can learn something from our calculator, have fun!
